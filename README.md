# amp_cs
Approximate message passing (AMP) for compressed sensing (CS) signal recovery.

**AMP_mmse_denoiser.ipynb**

Compares the mean squared error (MSE) performance of AMP decoders with soft-thresholding denoisers and minimum MSE (MMSE) denoisers, assuming the signal distribution is known to the decoder.
Note: the MMSE denoiser is the conditional expectation operator.
